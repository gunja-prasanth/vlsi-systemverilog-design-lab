# Day 05 – Traffic Light Controller (Moore FSM)

## Objective
Design a Moore finite state machine to control traffic lights using
SystemVerilog with clean state transitions and reset handling.

## FSM States
- RED
- RED + YELLOW
- GREEN
- YELLOW

## Design Highlights
- Moore FSM implementation
- Enumerated state encoding
- Illegal state protection
- Clean reset behavior

## Verification
- Behavioral simulation in Vivado
- Reset and state transition verification
- Waveform-based validation

## Repository Structure
