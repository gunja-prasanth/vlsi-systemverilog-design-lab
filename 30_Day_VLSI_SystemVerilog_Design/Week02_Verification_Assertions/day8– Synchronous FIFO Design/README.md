# Day 8 – Synchronous FIFO Design

## Objective
Design and verify a parameterized synchronous FIFO
with proper pointer and status flag logic.

## Features
- Parameterized DATA_WIDTH
- Parameterized DEPTH
- Write and read pointers
- Full and empty flag detection
- MSB-based wrap detection

## Verification
- Basic write and read sequence tested
- Pointer increment verified
- Empty flag behavior validated
- Full logic structurally implemented
